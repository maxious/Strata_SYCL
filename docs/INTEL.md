# Strata on an Intel Arc

Strata's engine is CUDA. On an Intel Arc it runs as **Strata's own engine, ported to SYCL** (`sycl/`, the
section "The engine itself on Intel" below). It sits behind the same Strata server, so the OpenAI and Anthropic
APIs, streaming, tool calls, MCP and the web app are all unchanged. llama.cpp's SYCL backend is the comparison
point: it runs the same GGUF, several times slower.

**Every measured speed is in [INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md](INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md).** That covers this port, llama.cpp on
the same card, the history of each change, and results other people posted for the B50, the B580 and two B70s.
This file explains how the port works and how to run it.

Everything Intel-specific lives in `sycl/`. No shared file of upstream's is changed, so upstream merges stay clean.
`sycl/setup_intel.py` and `sycl/serve/server_intel.py` wrap upstream's `setup.py` and `serve/server.py` from
outside.

Written for and tested on an **Arc Pro B70 (32 GB)** running the Coder (IQ1_M) on Ubuntu 24.04.

## Setup

Build the engine and its runtime image first ("How to build it" below), then:

    python3 sycl/setup_intel.py [setup.py's options, e.g. --model IQ2_XS --context 32768 --port 8085]

This is upstream's `setup.py`, run with the Intel steps swapped in. It imports setup.py and replaces those steps;
setup.py itself is unchanged. The model choice, download, pack, tokenizer, MTP draft layer, and the context and KV
questions are setup's own. What changes:

- **GPU check:** the Arc is found in sysfs (vendor 8086 under `xe` or `i915`) and offered through setup's AMD
  path. That is the path that builds locally and has no images.
- **Engine step:** it uses the SYCL build (`build-sycl-aot/strata`, run in the `strata-sycl-dev` image by
  `sycl/serve/strata-sycl.sh`) instead of compiling CUDA or HIP.
- **RAM rule:** setup's RAM rule does not apply. The CUDA engine keeps every expert in RAM; the port streams them
  from the GGUF into VRAM (`--stream-experts`), so RAM only decides the KV streaming. `--check` lists what fits by
  VRAM.
- **The config:**
  - It uses the container's paths and `"backend": "sycl"`.
  - The VRAM reserve is 1,024 MiB up to 32K, and 2,048 MiB with 4,096-token prompt chunks above that.
  - KV streaming (`--kv-resident 32768`) is on from 64K up when the RAM holds the KV.
  - A `model_switcher` or `sampling` block from an earlier config is kept.
  - `run-<model>.sh` starts `sycl/serve/server_intel.py`.

If a future `setup.py` drops a step this relies on, it stops with a message instead of writing a wrong config.
The models, packs and checkout must sit under the folder `strata-sycl.sh` mounts at `/work`. That is the folder
above the checkout, or `STRATA_SYCL_ROOT`.

Then `run-<model>.sh` (or `sycl/setup_intel.py` again) starts the model. `--port N` and `--host 0.0.0.0` work as
in upstream's setup.

**Several cards.** The image pins `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0`. `serve/strata-sycl.sh` forwards the
host's value when it is set. Without one, a `--layer-split` defaults to `level_zero:gpu`, so the engine sees every
card.

## Things that matter on this GPU

These apply to running llama.cpp by hand on the card.

- **`SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT` must be 0.** The persistent JIT cache segfaults on Xe2 during the first
  compile. The start script sets it; if you run llama-server by hand, do too.
- **The whole model goes on the card** (`--n-gpu-layers 999`), except `per_layer_token_embd.weight`, the single
  28.8 GB tensor of shard 2.
  - `--override-tensor per_layer_token_embd=CPU` keeps that tensor in host memory, mmapped and paged from the SSD
    by row, which is how the model's authors serve it.
  - Host RSS stays around 2 GB.
- **Thinking.** The model reasons before it answers. Strata's web app has the setting; for an API client, either:
  - put `{"reasoning_effort": "none"}` in `strata-<model>.shared-settings.json` next to the config, or
  - send `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}` per request.

  Without one of those, a short `max_tokens` is spent entirely inside the think block and the answer looks empty.
- **`/health` says 503 while loading**; the server polls `/props` instead.

## How much context fits

This table is for llama.cpp. The architecture keeps the KV small: only every fourth layer is full attention (12 of
48). The other 36 are gated-delta-net layers, with a fixed-size recurrent state that does not grow with context.

- **What each token keeps:** the 12 attention layers keep 2 KV heads x 256 x (K + V) at q8_0, plus the
  sparse-attention indexer's keys.
- **Measured: about 20 KiB per token.** VRAM grows 0.6 GB per 32K of context with everything else unchanged.

| context | VRAM in use, model loaded | headroom on 32 GB | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32,768 | 28.4 GB | 3.5 GB | measured, the default |
| 65,536 | 29.0 GB | 2.9 GB | measured, loads |
| 98,304 | 29.6 GB | 2.3 GB | measured, loads |
| 131,072 | 30.3 GB | 1.5 GB | **measured, the practical ceiling**: a 104,798-token prompt read and answered |
| 163,840 | ~31.0 GB | ~0.9 GB | not attempted: under the 1.2 GB safety margin |
| 262,144 | ~32.6 GB | none | **does not fit - asking for it took the host down** |

**Do not ask for more than fits.**

- **What goes wrong:** on this driver, a GPU allocation past VRAM does not fail. The xe driver evicts buffers into
  host RAM, the kernel runs out of memory, and the machine livelocks until its hardware watchdog resets it.
- **It has happened:** a 262K request did exactly that on 2026-09-29. llama.cpp's own "failed to fit params" check
  fired too late to prevent it.
- **What to do:** compute the KV size first and leave 1.5 GB free.

## The engine itself on Intel: the SYCL port (`sycl/`)

This is Strata's own engine built for the Arc with oneAPI: the 50 CUDA kernels and the host code that drives them
(streams, events, graph capture, pinned memory). It is a migration of the tree, not a new backend: the engine has
no backend seam to slot into.

**Layout.** `sycl/src` and `sycl/include` mirror the tree and hold only the files the port changes. The SYCL build
(`sycl/CMakeLists.txt`) takes every other source from the original location, and no upstream file is edited.
`sycl/include/dpct/` is the vendored SYCLomatic helper library, so the port builds without the migration tool.

**How it was made, so it can be redone.**

1. **`sycl/tools/Dockerfile`:** the dev image. It is the llama.cpp SYCL image plus SYCLomatic (`dpct` 2025.3),
   ninja, and the CUDA 12.8 headers that `sycl/tools/get-cuda-headers.sh` pulls out of NVIDIA's pip wheels. dpct
   parses CUDA, so it needs the headers, not the toolkit.
2. **`sycl/tools/migrate.sh`:** writes a compilation database for the 86 CUDA-touching translation units and runs
   dpct over them. 85 migrate; dpct reports no line it could not migrate, and about 1,400 advisory notes.
3. **`sycl/tools/fixups.py`:** what dpct got wrong or could not do, as an idempotent script with a reason per item.
   The ones that mattered:
   - CUDA's null stream means the default stream; dpct turned it into a null `sycl::queue*`. Every stream cast now
     goes through `strata::q_of()` (`sycl/include/strata/sycl_queue.hpp`).
   - `__ldg((const float*) p)` came out as `*p`, reading one byte of a float scale (two sites, s_gemv).
   - `__fadd_rn(a, b ? c : d)` lost its parentheses.
   - The ggml lookup tables were threaded through kernel parameters with the wrong table per template. They are
     plain `static const` arrays read from device code now, as ggml-sycl does.
   - A free-memory query written as an `if` with an initializer was dropped entirely. That one is the layer
     split's `stage_room()`, and it made every later card report 0 bytes free.
   - Smaller items:
     - helper headers renamed since dpct 2025.3 (`entangle`, `chunked_partition`);
     - graph introspection and `cudaGraphUpload`, which have no SYCL equivalents;
     - `%globaltimer` (the stage profiler reads zeros).
4. **`sycl/tools/build.sh`:** configure and build with icpx inside the image. Two compiler flags are load-bearing:
   - `-fp-model=precise`: icpx defaults to a fast FP model.
   - `-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt` for the device compiler. The Arc's fp32 divide is not correctly
     rounded by default (OpenCL allows 2.5 ulp), and Strata's quantizers are byte-exact against ggml through
     `amax / 127`. Without the flag `quantize_act_parity` has 303k mismatches; with it, none.

**Parity tests.** The whole tree builds and links: the `strata` binary plus the kernel parity tests.

| parity test | result |
|---|---|
| bf16_gemv, cvec, dequant_s2, elementwise, gdn, gr, kv_q4, kv_q8, kv_stream, qsa, quantize_act, rope, router_top10, s2_gemv, s2_gemv_q8, s_gemv, s_gemv_q8k, sampler, shared_expert, iq_multi (IQ2_XS included) | pass |
| kv_hybrid_parity, qsa_prompt_attn_parity (int8 and fp16 XMX cases) | pass |
| qsa_prompt_attn_parity, Q4_0 tensor-core cases (#452) | "refused": the port does not have that mode |
| iq_parity, ple_parity, native_expert_parity | need fixtures or model files |
| s2_expert_grouped_parity | fails (the s2 path, unused here) |

**How to run it by hand.** This is a greedy test run, the way the engine numbers are measured. Run it inside the
`strata-sycl-dev` image, with the AOT build in `build-sycl-aot/`:

```
STRATA_VERIFY_DEVICE_PLAN=1 STRATA_VERIFY_NO_HOST=1 \
build-sycl-aot/strata --pack <iq pack> --native <shard1> --ple-gguf <shard2> \
    --expert-profile data/expert-profile-coder.bin --expert-cache auto --stream-experts \
    --prefill auto --spec 4 --spec-min-p 0.5 --mtp <mtp rt dir> --max-context 8192 --tokens <ids> --max-new 64 --greedy
```

- **`--stream-experts`** (this port): no resident host copy of the experts. Every one of the 12,288 goes from the
  GGUF into the VRAM cache through a small staging ring (`GgufExpertSource`). Upstream needs 32 GB of RAM for this
  model; with the flag the engine runs on 23 GiB.
- **`STRATA_VERIFY_DEVICE_PLAN=1`:** the GPU plans each layer itself (upstream's E-6, off by default there).
- **`STRATA_VERIFY_NO_HOST=1`** (this port): the host waits for the whole window graph instead of per-layer
  rings. Only valid with every expert resident or in the pinned host mirror.
- **`--mtp`:** the base Qwen3.8-Flash-Next checkpoint's MTP draft layer (`tools/mtp_fetch.py fetch`,
  `mtp_pack.py --experts q2_0`, `mtp_rt.py`; 4.9 GB downloaded, 809 MiB of VRAM). It drafts for the Coder
  fine-tune with the same greedy tokens. The suffix drafter alone is rarely accepted on this card, which makes the
  draft layer the lever for decode.
- **IDs over 128 KB:** 80K-token ids exceed Linux's 128 KB single-argument limit, so use `--tokens-file`.

AOT device code is what runs: `AOT=bmg-g31 BUILD_DIR=.../build-sycl-aot`. Without AOT, the runtime JIT-compiles
every kernel on first use, which is slow the first time a process runs.
`SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1 SYCL_CACHE_DIR=<dir>` keeps the result across runs.

**What the port had to get right beyond compiling.** Each item is an entry in `sycl/tools/fixups.py` or a flag.

- **Host-mapped flags.** Strata's decode is a GPU/CPU handshake through host-mapped memory.
  - `volatile` device loads do not bypass the caches on Intel. System-scope atomics do, and they are the only thing
    measured to work (`sycl/probe/doorbell.cpp`, six variants).
  - Host-to-device visibility *during* a kernel stays unreliable on this platform. That is why the all-resident
    path waits for the window instead.
- **Bounded spins.** A device spin that never sees its flag is not a hang of one process.
  - The xe driver times the queue out and resets the GT node by node; a window graph has 2,400 nodes.
  - The card then stays wedged until a reboot (twice).
  - Every spin is capped (`kSpinMax`).
- **32-lane sub-groups.** The kernels are written for warps. dpct pinned 134 of 289 launches; the rest would run
  at Xe2's default 16 (`-fsycl-default-sub-group-size=32`).
- **Synchronous copies.** `cudaMemcpy` blocks, but dpct's default-queue `memcpy` did not wait. With the streaming
  ring, that filled the expert cache from overwritten buffers: non-deterministic residuals, NaN by layer 5. It was
  found with the per-layer residual ladder (`STRATA_VERIFY_DEBUG=1` prints R after every layer).
- **No host thread waits on a queue's event that another queue's barrier uses.**
  - Under the Level Zero v2 adapter, such an event no longer releases the other barrier, and the GPU waits forever.
  - The stager and the PLE upload mark their copies with a sequence number the copy queue writes into page-locked
    memory. The host polls that number instead.
  - See "Prompt-slot borrowing: the hang" below.
- **No non-char type punning in device code.** A `uint16_t*` read through an `int2` is not honoured by the SYCL
  device compiler; extract with shifts (see "Two model-specific bugs").
- **`native_expert_parity` was hand-ported.** The GPU native expert kernel matches ggml's float reference on real
  IQ1_M rows (rel 1.1e-2, the same class as the CPU path).

**Profiling.**

- `sycl/benchy.sh` (benchy v1) runs the standard bench (`sycl/tools/perf_matrix.py`): every model x the v1 prompt
  sizes, with each model's serve config, from a cold page cache. Its report is what INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md asks
  submitters to post.

- `sycl/tools/Dockerfile.unitrace` builds the dev image with Intel's unitrace. Run `unitrace -d` around the engine,
  then `sycl/rank_kernels.py`, for device time per kernel.
- `strata-sycl-dev:metrics`, with Intel's metrics libraries and `dev.xe.observation_paranoid=0`, gives hardware
  counters.
- `mmvq_bench`, `mmvq_sg_bench`, `q6k_align_bench`, `xmx_gemm_bench`, `xmx_int8_bench` and
  `native_expert_parity NATIVE_BENCH=1` time kernels in isolation. Warm the clocks first: a 5 ms run measures the
  ramp, not the kernel.
- `STRATA_PLE_TRACE=1` traces each PLE gather.
- `STRATA_DBG_NAN=1` reports the first non-finite values per layer, including the experts' fp16 GEMM inputs.

**Two traps worth knowing.**

- **`--prefill-until N` with a native pack** does not feed the rest of the prompt through the token loop (that
  loop is skipped for native packs). The tokens after N are dropped and the model free-runs. Compare output tokens
  between paths, never only timings.
- **Identical greedy runs can decode at two speeds.** One PLE read stall lands either in the prompt's PLE wait or
  in the first decode round. It is a once-per-process cost, not lost throughput, so compare runs on time to first
  token plus decode.

### How the prompt path uses VRAM

- **The VRAM plan.** `--expert-cache auto` fills the card down to `--vram-reserve-mib` *before* two things exist:
  the KV state and the prompt chunk buffers. With too small a reserve at long contexts, the driver starts
  migrating buffers and the run never finishes. Setup's reserves (1,024 MiB to 32K; 2,048 MiB with
  `--prefill 4096` above) leave room.
- **Streamed experts.** Experts the cache does not hold are copied for every chunk, in one of two walks:
  - **Stream-all:** every non-resident expert, layer by layer ahead of the compute. This is the default when the
    VRAM holds more than 90% of the (layer, expert) pairs.
  - **Routed-only:** only the experts the chunk routes to (`STRATA_PREFILL_RING=8`). This is the default otherwise.
    Past 90%, stream-all would copy several times the routed experts.

  `STRATA_PREFILL_STREAM_ALL=1` / `=0` force a walk. The stager threads read the blobs themselves; an early version
  held `GgufExpertSource::blob()` pointers across reads of the ring, and those blobs were overwritten before they
  were copied.
- **Prompt-slot borrowing.**
  - **Without it:** the reserve evicts experts from VRAM for good, and decode after a long prompt is slow.
  - **With it:** the prompt path borrows cache slots for its buffers and refills them in about a second afterwards.
  - **The cost:** a second on short prompts. So the port borrows by default only above a 32K context;
    `--prefill-borrow` / `--no-prefill-borrow` decide explicitly.
- **KV streaming** (`--kv-resident`) keeps the whole KV in pinned host memory and only the attended window in VRAM,
  so the KV pushes no experts out. Setup turns it on from 64K up and keeps INT8, the faster KV format at every size
  measured.
  - `--kv k8v4` does not support streaming yet. Setup keeps its KV in VRAM, which pushes more experts out to the
    host mirror.
  - k8v4 reads prompts fastest, because it needs no streaming copies.
- **The pinned host mirror.** At start-up, every expert without a VRAM slot is read into pinned host memory
  (`STRATA_MIRROR_MIB`; by default free RAM less 4 GiB). The device-built verify plan points the expert kernels
  straight at it over PCIe. That is how a model bigger than VRAM runs: the original IQ2_XS keeps about a quarter of
  its experts there.

### XMX (Intel's matrix engine)

oneMKL's FP16 GEMMs already run on the XMX units, so the prompt path is bound by the dequant that feeds them, not by
the products. Every hand-written joint_matrix kernel so far is correct but loses to the existing paths on this card
(numbers in [INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md](INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md), "XMX experiments").

- **`xmx_gemm_iq`:** a fused dequant + FP16 GEMM straight from the quantized rows.
- **`qsa_prompt_attn_xmx` v1 and v2:** the port of the mma.sync prompt attention, opt-in
  (`STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_XMX=1` for 64-cell chunks with 120 KB of local memory, or `=32`).
  - This attention is gather-bound: each query position selects its own ~2,000 cells, so the K/V fetch dominates.
  - Only 12 of the 16 matrix rows are real heads.
  - Grouping neighbouring positions would cut the gather but multiply the arithmetic, because their selections
    overlap little. It was not built.
- **Expert dot products on int8 DPAS for decode:** opt-in `STRATA_EXPERT_XMX=1`; do not enable. At 1-6 rows, the
  grid decode and the packed-B layout cost more than the DPAS saves, and one version hung the GPU.
- **An int8 DPAS GEMM straight from IQ4_NL for prompts** (`xmx_int8_bench`, standalone).
  - One 32-element block per DPAS, rescaled by d_x * d_w after each.
  - The per-block rescale keeps the matrix engine waiting.
  - The dequant it would save is small at expert size.
  - Not ported.

### Serving the port

`serve/server.py --engine strata` runs the SYCL engine unchanged through `sycl/serve/strata-sycl.sh`. That script
is an `exe` that starts the binary inside the oneAPI runtime image, with the serve pipes attached. Paths in the
config's `args` are the container's, with the data root mounted at `/work`. A config:

```json
{"engine": "strata", "exe": "<repo>/sycl/serve/strata-sycl.sh",
 "args": ["--pack", "/work/pack", "--native", "<shard 1>", "--ple-gguf", "<shard 2>",
          "--expert-profile", "data/expert-profile-coder.bin", "--expert-cache", "auto", "--stream-experts",
          "--prefill", "auto", "--spec", "4", "--spec-min-p", "0.5", "--mtp", "/work/mtp/rt",
          "--max-context", "32768", "--kv", "int8", "--vram-reserve-mib", "1024"],
 "sampling": {"temperature": 0.6, "top_p": 0.95, "top_k": 20, "repetition_penalty": 1.05}, ...}
```

**The reserve matters.** With `--stream-experts` there is no host copy of the experts beyond the pinned mirror. Any
expert left out of both is read from the SSD and computed on the CPU whenever it is routed, and decode collapses.
1,024 MiB fits all 12,288 Coder experts at 32K.

**Start time.** Starting a model is mostly the expert cache's fill from the GGUF. The fill is a pipeline:

- the slots are admitted in profile order first (the same placement);
- the reads go in file order, by up to 8 threads, into page-locked batches of 64;
- a batch's copies run while the next batch is read.

`STRATA_FILL_SERIAL=1` is the old fill: three slices read per expert, then a copy, then a wait.

**Logprobs.** `/v1/chat/completions` takes OpenAI's `"logprobs": true` and `"top_logprobs": 0..20`, streamed or
not, through `sycl/serve/server_intel.py`.

- **The reply** carries `choices[0].logprobs.content[]` (`token`, `logprob`, `bytes`, `top_logprobs`). With thinking
  on, the thinking tokens go under `reasoning_content`.
- **The engine** (the port only) gets `logprobs=K` on its GEN line. It writes an `LP logprob id:logprob ...` line
  after each `T` line, from the verify window's head logits. That is the distribution the token was taken from,
  before temperature, penalties and sampling.
- **Compatibility:** upstream's server ignores the lines, and an engine that is never asked writes none.
- **Cost:** each token costs one 1 MB logits row copy when asked.
- **Not yet:** `/v1/completions` and the Anthropic endpoint.

**The Monitor tab on Intel.** `sycl/serve/server_intel.py` is `serve/server.py` with two additions made at run
time:

- **GPU readings.** When NVML has no card, it plugs `sycl/serve/xe_telemetry.py` into `serve/telemetry.py`'s
  `gpu_reader`.
  - From sysfs: temperature, power and its cap, and the PCIe link the card trained at.
  - Load and VRAM come from `/run/gpustat.json`. xe reports them per client in `/proc/*/fdinfo`, which only root
    can read, so a small root sampler writes them (`sycl/tools/gpustat.py`; install it with its `gpustat.service`
    as its header says).
- **A Model menu.** A run config may name a `model_switcher`, an RPC taking `{"mode": m}`, for a host that swaps
  models on one card. The web app's header then gets a Model menu (`sycl/serve/web/switcher.js`, injected into the
  page).

**The engine exits directly** once its requests are done. It used to abort at exit in serve mode: a queue wait in a
destructor ran after the runtime's teardown began.

### Status of the planned work

1. **Expert dot products on XMX in integer mode** for decode: parked (see XMX above). Today it is scalar dp4a,
   ALU-bound. A decode window (up to 6 tokens) fits one INT8 DPAS (1-8 rows); three `joint_matrix` versions
   (opt-in `STRATA_EXPERT_XMX=1`, do not enable) were 1.4x and 2-3x slower than dp4a, the third hung the GPU.
2. **Experts missing from VRAM read from pinned host memory over PCIe instead of the SSD:** done (the host mirror).
3. **KV streaming from 64K up:** done.
4. **QSA block selection on XMX:** every query against every pooled block, a dense product that grows with the
   context. Open.
5. **The hot decode kernels re-tuned for Xe2's native 16-wide sub-groups:** tried, no gain in the engine
   (`STRATA_MMVQ_SG`: 16 all, 1 IQ4_XS only, 2 short outputs only; default 32). The real headroom was misaligned
   loads, since fixed:
   - A Q6_K block is 210 bytes, so every block's `ql`/`qh` runs start only 2-byte aligned. The B70 splits a
     misaligned 16-byte load into pieces.
   - The wide Q6_K kernel now does two aligned 16-byte loads and a shift (`load16_a2`; both stay inside the block),
     and takes every Q6_K shape and window width. `STRATA_MMVQ_A2=0` restores the old path.
   - The same treatment followed for Q4_K, Q5_K, IQ4_XS, Q8_0 and IQ4_NL ("Decode round 2" in
     INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md). The aligned-load helper only loads its second chunk when the address is unaligned, so it
     never reads a 16-byte chunk without a needed byte and cannot cross a page at the end of an allocation.
   - **IQ4_XS is not load-alignment-bound**: a `load16_a2` variant measured 2-9% slower (identical checksums) - it
     is LUT/ALU-bound at ~150-190 GB/s. See docs/sycl-experiments/04-decode-loads-alignment.md.
   - Switches back to the old paths:

     | switch | restores |
     |---|---|
     | `STRATA_MMVQ_WIDE_32=0` | the old Q8_0/IQ4_NL kernels |
     | `STRATA_GR_DOWN_SLICED=0` | the direct GR down kernel |
     | `STRATA_PLAN_PARALLEL=0` | the serial resident plan |
     | `STRATA_GR_DOWN_DIRECT=0` | GR down staging its activations in local memory |
     | `STRATA_MMVQ_WIDE_K=0` | the old K-quant kernels |

   - Some of these change the summation order. A long greedy continuation can then flip at a near-tie.
6. **INT8 prompt GEMMs:** experts dequantized to INT8, run as oneMKL/oneDNN INT8 on XMX. Open. A fused int8 kernel
   was tried (`xmx_int8_bench`) and lost.
7. **Fewer graph nodes per decode round** (~2,500): norm+rope, scores+top-k, gate+quantize fused. Open.
8. **Wider speculation** (two draft branches per verify window): the kernels are latency-bound, so it is nearly
   free. Open.
9. **A model bigger than VRAM:** done.
   - The original Qwen3.8-Flash-Next IQ2_XS runs on the B70 with 23 GB of RAM.
     - Shard 2 is byte-identical to the Coder's, so it is a hard link.
     - A native pack (`tools/iq_pack.py`).
     - The original model's expert profile and the same MTP draft layer.
   - Swift 1.5 runs the same way.
   - IQ3_XXS/IQ3_S (43-50 GB of experts) would need 19-26 GB mirrored, more than 23 GB of RAM allows on one card.
     Two cards hold them (see INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md, "Other people's cards").

## Keeping up with upstream

A merge of upstream `main` into `b70` leaves the copies in `sycl/` behind wherever upstream touched a file they
mirror. They are refreshed by re-migration, not by hand:

1. **Merge upstream into `b70`.** No shared file should conflict: the Intel code is all in `sycl/`. Then check that
   `sycl/setup_intel.py --check` and `sycl/serve/server_intel.py --engine mock` still run against the new setup.py
   and server.py.
2. **Migrate both trees.** The *old* upstream tree (a `git archive` of the pre-merge commit) goes through
   `migrate.sh` into `sycl-base`, and the merged tree into `sycl-new`. Each takes about 3 minutes in the dev image.
3. **Normalize both:** `sycl/tools/normalize.sh <dir> <commit>`. It covers dpct's file names, the unchanged files
   and the message serials, then runs `fixups.py`. Two runs of dpct on the same source now differ only in the
   kernel name hashes it generates.
4. **Merge:** `sycl/tools/merge_upstream.py BASE_OUT NEW_OUT OLD_REV NEW_REV` 3-way merges only the files upstream
   changed.
   - It canonicalizes dpct's kernel-name hashes to the port's first, and resolves hash-only hunks.
   - Copies dpct never produced take upstream's diff by hand: `verify.cpp`, `mtp.cpp`, `ple_reader.cpp` and
     `native_expert_parity.cpp`, which include no CUDA header directly.
   - New parity tests are copied in and listed in `sycl/CMakeLists.txt`.
   - `git merge-file --diff-algorithm=histogram` aligns big restructures better.
   - To port open upstream PRs ahead of upstream: migrate main plus the PRs, and merge into only the files they
     touch. When upstream later merges them, that "main + PRs" output is the merge base.
5. **Fix what the fixups missed.** A fixup whose pattern upstream changed shows up as a compile error; extend the
   fixup, re-run it, rebuild.
6. **Audit symbols.** Count the port's feature identifiers before and after. It has caught a dropped mirror hook and
   doorbell waits that had lost their spin bound.
7. **Check outputs.** Compare greedy output tokens against the previous build: Coder 19 / 2,184-token prompts,
   IQ2_XS, and a 40K prompt.

What each merge needed:

- **0.1.25-0.1.27 (2026-09-30):** the first re-migration. The draft layer's prompt pass became upstream's batched
  one.
- **0.1.31 (2026-10-01, 132 commits):** 45 migrated files changed for real, 38 conflicts.
  - **The expert kernels.** Upstream sends the i-quant experts to new multi kernels (one warp per row, 8 rows a
    group). The port's grid is sized for its own kernels (8 lanes a row, 32 rows a group).
    - With upstream's kernels on the port's grid, only a quarter of each expert's rows were written, and the output
      was end-of-text tokens.
    - The port's kernels stay the default; they also serve upstream's new Q4_K/Q5_K/Q5_1/Q8_0 experts.
    - `STRATA_EXPERT_SPLIT=1` runs upstream's kernels with their grid; `STRATA_GR_V3=1` runs upstream's GR read.
      Both are slower here and stay opt-in.
  - **Lanes per row** of the port's expert kernels are tunable at run time (`STRATA_GU_LANES` /
    `STRATA_DOWN_LANES`, 4/8/16/32). The default (8 / 8) stays.
  - **Three dpct mistranslations from the first migration,** found by upstream's new tests. dpct writes
    `__fadd_rn(a, b)` as `a + b` without parentheses, so `__fadd_rn(sum, c ? x : y)` became `sum + c ? x : y`.
    The three places:
    - the native QSA indexer's per-token pooled key: blocks completed while generating got wrong pooled keys;
    - the native QSA scores, an opt-in path;
    - the s2 activation rounding: every value was 0, in the Q2_0 s2 pack, which is unused here.

    `fixups.py` parenthesises now.
- **0.1.32 (2026-10-01, 89 commits):** hash-only differences are canonicalized before the merge, which left 10 real
  conflicts.
  - **Async commit:** upstream's `set_commit_async` / `wait_commit` maps onto the port's deferred commit
    (`commit(n, err, false)` + `commit_finish`).
  - **New hyper-connection read variants:** upstream's are not used. The port keeps its sliced down / split norm
    read, renamed `gr_norm_split_port_kernel`.
  - **The read-variant self-test** segfaulted on the B70, so on SYCL it runs only with `STRATA_HC_CHECK=1`.
  - **Kernel names:** two collided after hash canonicalization (renamed).
  - **fused_gr's** per-block shared-memory query is a fixup now.
- **0.1.33 (2026-10-01, 17 commits):** two conflicts.
  - `--resident-cpu-experts` (upstream's new `resident_cpu_explicit`) beside the port's `--stream-experts`.
  - The prompt attention's compute-capability check: the port keeps its XMX dispatch.
- **0.1.35 + seven open PRs (2026-10-02):** ported ahead of upstream.
  - **#374 needed two port fixes:**
    - Its next-chunk read assumed every chunk is the full chunk length. The port's first chunk is 256 tokens, so the
      second chunk's rows were read from the wrong place.
    - Its host wait on the PLE upload's event deadlocked past ~4K tokens (the Level Zero v2 bug above).
  - **#413's gate** is an NVIDIA SM-count rule, and its parity test an NVIDIA bench (not built).
  - **The PRs:**

    | PR | what | in the port |
    |---|---|---|
    | #385 (sergqwer) | stager: a buffer's first job of a generation waits for the previous DMA from it | race fix |
    | #463 (constantindjonkam) | decode waits for an adaptive swap before reading the residency table | determinism fix |
    | #453 (architectds) | the drafter's batched K/V on the KV-streaming ring | on |
    | #374 (sergqwer) | the first chunk's PLE rows read beside layer 0 | on, with two port fixes |
    | #363 (BlueKingMuch) | the PCIe expert call: group stride, fused SwiGLU + q8_1 | re-done on the port's lane kernels |
    | #407 (sergqwer) | `--adapt-tuned` | opt-in |
    | #413 (BlueKingMuch) | DeltaNet recurrence per key head | opt-in (`STRATA_GDN_KEYHEAD=1`): slower here |
- **0.1.38 (2026-10-03, 83 commits):** upstream merged the seven PRs, so their header forks in `sycl/include` are
  gone.
  - **New in the port with it:**
    - the DeltaNet output norm without its dead FP32 store;
    - two prompt-path fixes: the fused layout's buffers, and the streamed walk's resident lookup;
    - `STRATA_GR_DOWN_MAX4=1`, opt-in and neutral here.
  - **Stubbed:**
    - `--peer-device`, a second GPU as an expert-cache tier. Upstream's code is CUDA calls; `open` refuses with a
      message.
    - The fused int8 prompt kernels (#136), part of the MMQ library the port does not build.
  - **Off on SYCL:** the sm_90 thread-block-cluster greedy sampler and QSA top-k. They have no SYCL counterpart,
    and the callers take the plain kernels.

## Bugs worth remembering

**Prompt-slot borrowing: the hang (fixed 2026-10-01).** From 0.1.31 on, a prompt that borrowed cache slots stopped
in its first full chunk, with the GPU at 100% and the host waiting on the compute queue.

- **Not a borrowing bug.** Borrowing is just the only way the Coder streams experts during a prompt (every expert is
  resident otherwise), and the streamed path's stager deadlocked.
- **How the stager deadlocked:**
  - Its threads read experts into a ring of 16 page-locked buffers.
  - To reuse a buffer, a thread waited on the copy queue's event for the DMA that last read it. That is the CUDA
    form, `cudaEventSynchronize`.
  - Under the Level Zero v2 adapter, once a host thread had waited on that event, it no longer released the other
    queue's barrier that also listed it. The GPU waited forever.
  - It only happened once a layer streamed more than 16 experts, when the ring wrapped.
- **What ran fine:** the v1 adapter (`SYCL_UR_USE_LEVEL_ZERO_V2=0`), a 256-buffer ring, and a sync after every phase
  (`STRATA_PREFILL_SYNC=1`, kept as a debug switch).
- **The fix:** the copy queue writes a sequence number into page-locked host memory after each DMA, and the stager
  polls it. Output is bit-identical to the run without borrowing.

**Two model-specific bugs found with Swift 1.5 (fixed 2026-10-01).** UkisAI's Swift 1.5 IQ2_XS (setup's `swift`
family, the same GSQ-RCO layout) decoded token 0 forever: NaN logits from layer 13 on.

- **`--stream-experts` read the wrong shard.**
  - Since upstream 0.1.31, `ExpertLayout::gguf_file` is per layer AND role (`3 * layer + role`), because a shard
    boundary can fall inside a layer.
  - The port's `GgufExpertSource` still indexed it by layer. So a layer in shard 2 was read from shard 1 at
    shard 2's offsets: garbage IQ1_M scales, then infinities after the fp16 dequantization.
  - The original model keeps every expert in shard 1 and never noticed; Swift's layers 13-47 are in shard 2.
- **IQ2_XS products were garbage.**
  - ggml's `vec_dot_iq2_xs` reads its four 16-bit codes through a `uint16_t*` to an `int2`. The SYCL device
    compiler does not honour that type punning.
  - The dequantizer, which reads the codes directly, was exact.
  - The codes are extracted by shifts now (the dot and the expert kernels' `Split<17>`).
  - `iq_multi_parity` checks against a CPU decode from ggml's tables too, and passes.

**The layer split's free memory (fixed 2026-10-03).** A layer split across two B70s crashed at the second card's
expert cache ("no room").

- Upstream reads free memory in an `if` with an initializer, and dpct dropped the call itself. So every later stage
  saw 0 bytes free.
- The call is restored, and `tools/fixups.py` re-applies it after a re-migration.
- Found and tested on 2x B70 by tmking01 in the upstream PR review.

**Load time (2026-10-02).** Starting a model is mostly the expert cache's fill from the GGUF (`--stream-experts`):
the Coder's 23.4 GiB of experts took 64-76 s, the IQ2_XS's 24.9 GiB 91 s, because the fill read each expert's
three slices, copied the blob and waited for the copy before the next read. It is a pipeline now: the slots are
admitted in profile order first (the same placement), the reads go in file order by up to 8 threads into
page-locked batches of 64, and a batch's copies run while the next one is read. Cold page cache: 76.2 s -> 18.8 s
(0.33 -> 1.34 GB/s); a whole Coder start from the engine's launch to its first token 82 s -> 26 s, the IQ2_XS
120 s -> 41 s (its 8.2 GB host mirror is ~9 s of the rest). Output identical. `STRATA_FILL_SERIAL=1` is the old fill.

**0.1.35 and seven open upstream PRs (2026-10-02).** Upstream main 0.1.33 -> 0.1.35 merged as before, then seven open
PRs ported into `sycl/` ahead of upstream (one dpct run of main + all of them, 3-way merged into only the files they
touch; `sycl/tools/merge_upstream.py`). Their header changes live in `sycl/include` until upstream merges them.

| PR | what | on the B70 |
|---|---|---|
| #385 (sergqwer) | stager: a buffer's first job of a generation waits for the previous DMA from it | race fix; same output |
| #463 (constantindjonkam) | decode waits for an adaptive swap before reading the residency table | determinism fix |
| #453 (architectds) | the drafter's batched K/V on the KV-streaming ring | 128K int8: 888 -> 895 tok/s prompt, 66.6 -> 67.0 decode |
| #374 (sergqwer) | the first chunk's PLE rows read beside layer 0 | part of the 2,184-token prompt's 784 -> 825 tok/s |
| #363 (BlueKingMuch) | the PCIe expert call: group stride, fused SwiGLU + q8_1 | IQ2_XS decode +1.7%; re-done on the port's lane kernels |
| #407 (sergqwer) | `--adapt-tuned` (opt-in) | neutral here; stays opt-in |
| #413 (BlueKingMuch) | DeltaNet recurrence per key head | bit-identical but 8% slower prompt here: off (`STRATA_GDN_KEYHEAD=1`) |

#374 needed two port fixes: its next-chunk read assumed every chunk is the full chunk length (the port's first chunk
is 256 tokens: the second chunk's rows were read from the wrong place), and its host wait on the PLE upload's event,
now inside the layer loop, deadlocked the prompt past ~4K tokens under the Level Zero v2 adapter (the stager's bug
again): the upload is marked by a polled sequence number now. #413's gate is an NVIDIA SM-count rule and its parity
test an SM-holding NVIDIA bench (not built). Outputs identical to 0.1.33 (Coder 19 / 2,184 tokens, IQ2_XS, 40K).

**Not ported yet (2026-10-01).**

- Three kernels carry inline PTX (`mma.sync` tensor-core matrix ops, `ldmatrix`, `cp.async`):
  `qsa_prompt_attn`, `qsa_select`'s block scores, `native_qsa_score`. The SYCL build takes the "older card"
  fallback the CUDA build uses below sm_80. `qsa_prompt_attn` also has an XMX version (`joint_matrix`, opt-in
  `STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_XMX=1`): correct, but slower than the fallback (see "XMX prompt attention v2").
- The ggml MMQ prefill path (`moe_mmq.cu`) is not built. **Decided 2026-10-03 (experiment 09):** the SYCL
  i-quant prompt matmul was ported (mmvq `mul_mat_vec_q_iq*_q8_1` kernels beind `strata::prefill::mmq`) and is
  parity-exact and CUDA-free, but a measured ~6x prefill regression (73 vs 571.7 tok/s at 1,280 tokens: the
  matvec shape's per-token i-quant dots lose to oneMKL GEMM - same reason llama.cpp keeps SYCL MMQ off,
  `supports_mmq`->false). Kept **opt-in** (`STRATA_PREFILL_MMQ=1`; default off); the FP16 dequant+oneMKL path
  stays the default at 571.7 tok/s. A real prompt win needs a GEMM-shaped INT8 path, not a matvec port.
- AOT device code is what runs: `AOT=bmg-g31 BUILD_DIR=.../build-sycl-aot` (the JIT build costs ~47 s of
  compiling on the first window).

## Not done

- **Images,** on both Intel engines. Strata's vision path encodes with `strata-vision` into embeddings the CUDA
  engine reads; neither the SYCL port nor the llama.cpp config wires it yet.
- **Three kernels with inline PTX** (`mma.sync` tensor-core matrix ops, `ldmatrix`, `cp.async`): `qsa_prompt_attn`,
  `qsa_select`'s block scores and `native_qsa_score`. The SYCL build takes the "older card" fallback the CUDA build
  uses below sm_80.
- **The ggml MMQ prefill path** (`moe_mmq.cu`) needs llama.cpp's ggml-cuda sources; not built.
- **`--peer-device`:** stubbed.
- **Speculative decoding on the llama.cpp path:** the GGUF carries no draft layer llama.cpp can use. The SYCL port
  has it (`--mtp`).
