# benchy v1: the standard benchmark of Strata's SYCL engine on an Intel Arc, so every card runs the same bench.
#
#   sycl/benchy.sh [--configs strata-a.json,...] [--sizes 20,2185,...] [--warm] [--force] [--out DIR]
#
# What it runs:
# - Every model you set up with sycl/setup_intel.py (each strata-*.json next to the checkout with "backend": "sycl";
#   steering variants are left out), each with its own serve config, unchanged.
# - The v1 prompts (sycl/bench/v1): 20, 2,185, 8,000, 40,000, 128,000 and 256,000 tokens, each followed by 256
#   greedy tokens. A size that does not fit the config's --max-context is skipped and listed.
# - Each run is a fresh engine process, after the page cache is dropped (root, so it re-runs itself with sudo; --warm
#   skips the drop and the sudo, and the table says it was warm).
#
# Stop the served model first: benchy refuses to start while more than 2 GB of VRAM is in use (--force overrides).
# A full run takes 30-60 minutes on a B70 (the 128K and 256K prompts are most of it).
#
# Post sycl/benchy-results/v1-<date>/matrix.md and its config-*.txt files with your results (docs/INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md,
# "Submitting numbers"). The bench's prompts, sizes and columns stay fixed within a version; a change is a new version.
